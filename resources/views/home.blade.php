	<h1>Welcome to the Confer test site.</h1>
	<p>Confer is a package for Laravel 5 which makes implementing a real-time chat and messaging service into your website or application a breeze.</p>
	<p>Testing is simple - start messaging in the global conversation, or create a private chat with another online user. Hey, if you're feeling really wild, why not add some more users to a private conversation and turn it into a group complete with it's own name? Just try not to have too much fun.</p>
